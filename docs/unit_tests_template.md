# **Unit Test Documentation and Template**

## **1. General Structure**
Each test file should include the following sections:
1. **Imports**: Import `unittest`, `logging`, `MagicMock`, and the class to be tested.
2. **Logging Configuration**: Set logging to display test activity.
3. **Class-Level Documentation**: Describes the purpose of the test class and the attributes that are shared across tests.
4. **Setup Method**: Prepares any dependencies, mock objects, and initializes key class instances.
5. **Test Methods**: Each method tests a specific behavior of the class.

---

## **2. Class Documentation Template**
```python
class Test[ClassName](unittest.TestCase):
    """
    **Test[ClassName]** tests the **[ClassName] class** to ensure that its methods behave as expected.
    
    **Attributes:**
        mock_[Dependency] (MagicMock): A mock version of the [Dependency] class.
        [instance] ([ClassName]): An instance of the [ClassName] class being tested.
    """
```
**Explanation**:
- **Purpose**: State the overall purpose of the test class.
- **Attributes**: List all key attributes, especially mock objects and key instances shared across tests.

---

## **3. Setup Method Template**
```python
    def setUp(self):
        """
        **Setup method for Test[ClassName].**
        
        **Purpose:**
        Initializes mock dependencies and an instance of the [ClassName] being tested.
        
        **Attributes:**
            self.mock_[Dependency] (MagicMock): A mock version of the [Dependency] class.
            self.[instance] ([ClassName]): An instance of the [ClassName] class being tested.
        """
        self.mock_[Dependency] = MagicMock()  # Mock version of the dependency
        self.[instance] = [ClassName](self.mock_[Dependency])  # Create an instance of the class being tested
```
**Explanation**:
- **Purpose**: Describes what the setup method does (initializes mocks, instances, etc.).
- **Attributes**: Documents all key instance variables created during setup.

---

## **4. Test Method Template**
```python
    def test_[method_name](self):
        """
        **Test for the [method_name] method of the [ClassName] class.**
        
        **Purpose:**
        Verifies that the [method_name] method behaves as expected.
        
        **Process:**
            1. Setup mock dependencies if necessary.
            2. Call the [method_name] method on the [ClassName] instance.
            3. Assert the results match expected output.
        
        **Attributes:**
            mock_variable (MagicMock): A mock instance of the dependency used in this test.
            result ([DataType]): The result returned by the method being tested.
        """
        mock_variable = MagicMock()  # Create a mock object if needed
        result = self.[instance].[method_name](mock_variable)  # Call the method being tested
        self.assertEqual(result, [expected_value])  # Assert that the result matches the expected output
```
**Explanation**:
- **Purpose**: Clear one-line summary of the test's goal.
- **Process**: Step-by-step explanation of the test process (setup, call, assert).
- **Attributes**: Documents the key variables used in this test.

## **5. Example of Full Test File**
```python
import unittest
import logging
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from refactored_quran_classes import [ClassName]

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class Test[ClassName](unittest.TestCase):
    """
    **Test[ClassName]** tests the **[ClassName] class** to ensure that its methods behave as expected.
    
    **Attributes:**
        mock_[Dependency] (MagicMock): A mock version of the [Dependency] class.
        [instance] ([ClassName]): An instance of the [ClassName] class being tested.
    """

    def setUp(self):
        """
        **Setup method for Test[ClassName].**
        
        **Purpose:**
        Initializes mock dependencies and an instance of the [ClassName] being tested.
        
        **Attributes:**
            self.mock_[Dependency] (MagicMock): A mock version of the [Dependency] class.
            self.[instance] ([ClassName]): An instance of the [ClassName] class being tested.
        """
        self.mock_[Dependency] = MagicMock()  # Mock version of the dependency
        self.[instance] = [ClassName](self.mock_[Dependency])  # Create an instance of the class being tested
    
    def test_[method_name](self):
        """
        **Test for the [method_name] method of the [ClassName] class.**
        
        **Purpose:**
        Verifies that the [method_name] method behaves as expected.
        
        **Process:**
            1. Setup mock dependencies if necessary.
            2. Call the [method_name] method on the [ClassName] instance.
            3. Assert the results match expected output.

            result ([DataType]): The result returned by the method being tested.

        mock_variable = MagicMock()  # Create a mock object if needed
        result = self.[instance].[method_name](mock_variable)  # Call the method being tested
        self.assertEqual(result, [expected_value])  # Assert that the result matches the expected output

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
**Explanation**:
- **Full Example**: Combines all templates into one working file.
- **Logging**: Ensures all test actions are logged for better traceability.

---

## **6. Best Practices**
- **One Method, One Test**: Each method should have its own test. Do not combine multiple method calls in a single test.
- **Use Mocking**: Use `MagicMock()` for dependencies that don't need to be tested.
- **Assertions**: Clearly explain each assertion and what it validates.
- **Logging**: Add logging to show what each test is doing.

By following this template, each unit test will have a clear, consistent, and maintainable structure. Following this approach will ensure that all classes and methods are fully tested and that the purpose of each test is clear to future developers.
